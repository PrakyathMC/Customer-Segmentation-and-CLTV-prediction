Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value Prediction for E-commerce
Description:
This project focuses on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to understand customer behavior and predict future spending in the e-commerce domain. The project is divided into two main phases: Customer Segmentation and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction.

1. Customer Segmentation:
Objective: Divide customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.
Methodology: Utilized RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to create features.
Algorithm: Applied K-means clustering to segment customers into clusters.
Results: Identified three distinct customer segments, each with unique purchasing patterns.
2. Customer Lifetime Value Prediction (Next 6 Months):
Objective: Predict the total value a customer is expected to bring over the next 6 months.
Methodology: Created features based on historical data and calculated actual CLTV based on future data.
Algorithm: Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict CLTV.
Results: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.794, with significant importance placed on the Monetary feature.
Summary:
The project provides actionable insights into customer behavior by segmenting customers based on purchasing habits and predicting future spending. The segmentation allows for targeted marketing and personalized engagement, while CLTV prediction helps in optimizing resource allocation.

The main findings include:

Highly Engaged Customers: A segment with frequent purchases and high spending.
Moderately Engaged Customers: A segment with occasional purchases and moderate spending.
Inactive Customers: A segment with infrequent purchases and low spending.
Importance of Past Spending: Historical spending (Monetary) is highly predictive of future spending.
